# Secret Protocol

Our protocol is run by all the secret nodes participating in the network. It allows developers to build applications that give users more power to control their data with encrypted processing.

### Cosmos / Tendermint

In the future, application-specific zones will use our network of SGX-enabled nodes for private computations. By implementing our `compute` module, any blockchain developer will gain the ability to utilize Secret Contracts in their system. In order to pay for gas, users will need Secret coins (SCRT), the native coin of our network. We believe trust in Enigma’s validator community will be an important factor in the decision to use our network, which should operate like a Secret Hub with many connections to other zones that need privacy.

### CosmWasm

This platform enables deploying "smart contracts" on multiple blockchains. CosmWasm is written as a module that can plug into the Cosmos SDK. This means that anyone currently building a blockchain using the Cosmos SDK can quickly and easily add CosmWasm smart contracting support to their chain, without adjusting existing logic.

Adding WebAssembly to the Cosmos SDK allows software written in many languages to run securely on a blockchain. WASM serves as an intermediate language that compiles the developer’s language of choice into a portable virtual machine. This means that you can have a simple, secure and fast VM set up to partition your application’s actions for better testing, security, performance and speed.

### Compute Module

This module for the Cosmos SDK, developed by Enigma's dev team, enables blockchain developers to leverage the power of Secret Network for decentralized applications. Private computation requires trust, and we believe you know the value of information these days.

### Secret Apps

These are unique technology solutions with privacy at the core, intending to empower users by giving them control of their data. Fully encrypted computation.

### How do I start building a Secret App?
