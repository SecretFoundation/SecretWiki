## Purpose

Secret Foundation is dedicated to building, researching, and scaling adoption of decentralized technologies with privacy at their core. The guiding values are Usability, Sustainability, Impact, and Empowerment. Our mission is to advance privacy as a human right and public good; to empower individuals through development and use of decentralized technologies; to protect freedom and create more valuable systems by eliminating data monopolies; and to build a sustainable network, foundation, and community that will work to instill these core values around the world.

## Activities

Among other activities, the Secret Foundation will: help establish efficient and effective governance and communication practices for the Secret Network community (and the foundation itself), produce useful educational materials, and advance research and development of privacy-preserving networks and applications while maintaining a global presence that helps to expand their positive impact and universal adoption. This wiki resource was created as a way for community members to self-organize into committees to discuss important topics related to Secret Network (such as governance, documentation, use cases, education, and marketing). To join, [follow these steps](#your-mission).

## Meetings

### Secret Network Governance Debriefing

The Secret Network governance committee gathers on a weekly basis for a meeting (attendance is optional). In this meeting, members will:

- Share progress from other committees
- Propose the creation of new committees

### Committee Discussions and Projects

Secret Network committee participants may self-organize into specific teams focused on a project, whether it is a simple task or complex initiative. Individual committees form their own charters, decide their own meeting schedules, and communicate in their own designated channels in the Secret RocketChat. Use the [meetings notes template](templates/meeting-notes-template.md) to take good meeting notes to keep the rest of the community aligned.

### How to form a new committee

1. [Join Secret Chat](https://chat.scrt.network).
2. Create a [charter](templates/charter-template.md) for your committee.
3. Submit a Pull Request to the SecretWiki repository adding your committee and charter. (See [here](committee) for examples.)
4. Propose your committee at the next Secret Network governance debriefing. If approved, your PR will be merged, you will get a designated channel in the Secret RocketChat, and your committee meeting schedule (detailed in the charter) will be added to the Secret Network calendar.
5. Recruit participants for your committee.
