# Pull Requests

## Make A Branch
Please create a separate branch for each issue that you're working on. Do not make changes to the default branch (e.g. master, develop) of your fork.

## Push Your Code ASAP
Push your code as soon as you can. Follow the "early and often" rule. Make a pull request as soon as you can and use "[WIP]" in the title.

## Describe Your Pull Request
* Use the format specified in pull request template for the repository. Populate the stencil completely for maximum verbosity.
* Tag the actual issue number by replacing #[issue_number] e.g. #42. This closes the issue when your PR is merged.
* Tag the actual issue author by replacing @[author] e.g. @issue_author. This brings the reporter of the issue into the conversation.
* Mark the tasks off your checklist by adding an x in the [ ] e.g. [x].
* Describe your change in detail.
* Describe how you tested your change.
* Check the Preview tab to make sure the Markdown is correctly rendered and that all tags and references are linked. If not, go back and edit the Markdown.

## Request Review
Once your PR is ready, remove the "[WIP]" from the title and/or change it from a draft PR to a regular PR. If a specific reviewer is not assigned automatically, please request a review from the project maintainer and any other interested parties manually.

## Incorporating feedback
If your PR gets a 'Changes requested' review, you will need to address the feedback and update your PR by pushing to the same branch. You don't need to close the PR and open a new one.

Be sure to re-request review once you have made changes after a code review. Asking for a re-review makes it clear that you addressed the changes that were requested and that it's waiting on the maintainers instead of the other way round.
