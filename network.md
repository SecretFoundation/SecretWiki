# Secret Nodes

Our network consists of nodes equipped with trusted execution environments, special computer chips made by Intel that enable data processing in a black box with the key locked inside.

### Validators

Up to 50 node operators at any time are validators of the Secret Network, which means they run and verify blockchain activity using a delegated proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, Tendermint.

### Network Economics

Our native coin is SCRT. Currently, total supply is over 50 million SCRT. Secret node operators and their delegators earn rewards by participating in the validation process. Most network parameters, such as the inflation rate, are decided through on-chain governance.

### Delegation

Delegation involves giving some of your staking power to a specific validator, who takes a percentage of the rewards. If there is an on-chain governance vote, a delegator's vote will be the same as their validator's, unless the delegator changes it.

### Governance

As a truly decentralized organization, the Secret Network and its complex ecosystem has to make decisions collectively using an efficient and effective combination of off-chain and on-chain governance.
