# Overview

Psychz is a cloud provider that is especially known for DDoS protection that is powerful and in expensive. A members of the #infrastructure committee worked with them outside of this project and had a good experience.

Overall they have no frills UI that allows for the BIOS access needed to properly configure SGX. They have been helpful offering moneyback if SGX couldn't be properly setup. Their servers are cheap and allow for easy payment with no commitments.

# What works

E3-12XXv5 Servers. This includes E3-1230v5 and E3-1270v5.

The current offering of all servers can be found [Here](https://www.psychz.net/dashboard/client/web/order/dedicated-server?processor=&processorBaseFreq=&numberOfCpu=7391&cpuCores=&location=)

# Minor Warning

I have had the experience where I order a 1230v5 and they give me a 1270v6 instead. This is somewhat understandable as it is a newer machine, so who is going to complain. Of Course it [won't work]() at this point in time.

If this happens, reach out to support and insist that you need a 1230v5 not v6. They should switch it with no problems.

# Bulk Offer

I have reached out to psychz about a bulk order. At this point I am not pursueing this for a few reasons. But if you are interested reach out to Sandy | Stake or Die. IF interest is great enough if may be worth it.

# How to
