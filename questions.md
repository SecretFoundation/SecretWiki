# Commonly Asked Questions

### What is the Secret Network?
The Secret Network is a decentralized network of computers (secret nodes) that utilize trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enable secure, private computation. This allows developers to build secret apps - unstoppable applications that can utilize encrypted data without ever exposing the data itself, even to the nodes in the network performing computations.

### Why Privacy?
Our community believes privacy is a fundamental human right and a public good, and it needs to be protected by our systems of communication. Meanwhile, data is often monopolized by powerful companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. We are dedicated to building solutions with privacy at the core to empower users with control of their valuable information.

### Why Blockchain?
Accountability is the reason for using a distributed system of trusted execution environments (TEEs). Secret Network is decentralized, which means a variety of organizations and individuals  participate in the community. The only way to build a sustainable solution is by creating a diverse and transparent culture, united by the purpose of data dignity for all!

### Why Trusted Execution Environments?
Other innovative solutions (multi-party computing, homomorphic encryption, private set intersection, zero-knowledge proofs, etc.) are simply not practical now, and we look forward to exploring their potential impact down the road. Itâ€™s a matter of scalability and security.

### What does Secret Network help solve?
Our stated mission: to advance privacy as a human right and a public good; to empower individuals through development and use of decentralized technologies; to protect freedom and create more valuable systems by eliminating data monopolies.

Secret nodes are computers within the Secret Network that perform computations on encrypted data. Secret Contracts are pieces of code written in the Rust programming language deployed on the Secret Network. Secret Apps utilize the capabilities of Secret Contracts in order to provide unique benefits like users having full data control, which means increased opportunities for growth and impact. Use cases include privacy-preserving credit scores, private on-chain auctions for cryptoart and other digital collectibles, and secret voting for any organization that needs to make a decision collectively. Imagine you could not only know every time a digital marketing company used your data, but also they might pay to use your data without getting access to the raw information.

### Why Cosmos?
Cosmos represents a standard approach to developing scalable and interoperable blockchain applications. We believe the Cosmos SDK, Tendermint and Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) are groundbreaking since they are looking ahead to a future of many interconnected, app-specific blockchains.

### How do I use SCRT?
SCRT is the native coin of the Secret Network, which means it denominates value for the users of Secret Apps. Holders of SCRT may bond their stake to a specific node in order to become a delegator, which means they have an opportunity to earn rewards by supporting a particular set of validators. 

### Why is Secret Network essential for Decentralized Finance?
Blockchains like Ethereum are public by default, and there are only weak attempts to provide transactional privacy. Our approach is differently motivated by solving for computational privacy. This enables any kind of DeFi product developer to leverage power of secure enclaves to reduce data liability and empower users with data control. Example: Salad

### What are the best use cases of private computation?
* Financial Privacy
* Machine Learning
* Reputation / Credit Scoring
* Secret Voting
* Access Control

### Is Secret Network a "Layer One" or "Layer Two"?
Layer infinity
