## What is Secret Network?

Want to build a better internet? Solve for privacy.

The Secret Network is a decentralized network of computers (which we call "secret nodes") that use hardware-based and software-based privacy technologies to enable **secure computation**. On top of this network, developers can build **Secret Apps** - unstoppable, permissionless applications that can utilize encrypted data without ever exposing the data itself, even to the nodes in the network performing computations.

Our mission: improve the adoption and usability of sustainable privacy solutions, for the benefit of all.
