  We're ready to reveal Secret Network [https://scrt.network]. You've found our

  first post. Keep reading to learn how you can join us and help build

  privacy-first applications and solutions.



  In February 2020, over 20 independent validators launched a new blockchain
  that

  at the time was known as the Enigma mainnet blockchain

  [https://blog.enigma.co/the-enigma-mainnet-has-launched-3bd0d40fe80d]. This

  mainnet is a proof-of-stake-based blockchain based on Cosmos SDK / Tendermint

You've found our first post. Keep reading to learn how you can join us and help build privacy-first applications and solutions.</h3><p></p><p>In February 2020, over 20 independent validators launched a new blockchain that at the time was known as the <a href="https://blog.enigma.co/the-enigma-mainnet-has-launched-3bd0d40fe80d">Enigma mainnet blockchain</a>. This mainnet is a proof-of-stake-based blockchain based on <a href="https://cosmos.network/" rel="noopener">Cosmos SDK / Tendermint</a> and secured by a new native coin, Secret (SCRT). The collective vision for this blockchain was to create a <strong>privacy-first chain </strong>that would allow smart contracts to utilize private and sensitive data. The network would utilize privacy technologies that could enable <strong>secure computation over encrypted data.</strong></p><p>For the past three months, even more validators have joined to help support and secure Secret Network, in addition to multiple contributors building network tooling, core protocol functionality, and much more.</p><p>Recently, a proposal was made utilizing on-chain governance to establish a clear brand for this network that would both reflect the name of the chain's native coin as well as the network's decentralized governance and broad community support.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://blog.scrt.network/content/images/2020/05/image.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>The full text of the on-chain branding proposal. Image from <a href="http://www.secretscan.io" rel="noopener">secretscan.io</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>This proposal passed with unanimous approval on May 17th, 2020.¬†</strong></p><p>The community is now ready - and proud - to introduce <strong><a href="https://scrt.network">Secret Network:</a> </strong>the same mainnet blockchain that has been in active use since February, but with a new name, new web properties, and new ways to get involved in the ecosystem.</p><p>Secret Network is an open-source network that protects data (and secrets) for users of decentralized applications (Secret Apps). It is the result of the collective and committed effort of its community and key contributors, including <a href="https://enigma.co">Enigma</a>, <a href="https://secretnodes.org">Secretnodes.org</a>, <a href="https://chainofsecrets.org">Chain Of Secrets</a>, and many others.</p><p>Read on to see what's new and how you can contribute to Secret Network.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.scrt.network/content/images/2020/05/Secret-Network-Logo-Hrztl-Black-w-BG-1.png" class="kg-image"></figure><h2 id="secret-network">Secret Network</h2><p>The branding of "Secret Network" follows the name of its native coin (Secret, SCRT) as well as existing concepts in the ecosystem such as <a href="https://secretnodes.org">secret nodes</a>, <a href="https://blog.enigma.co/defining-secret-contracts-f40ddee67ef2">secret contracts</a>, and Secret Apps.</p><p>Secret Network now has its own community-maintained website: <a href="https://scrt.network" rel="noopener"><strong>https://scrt.network</strong></a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2160/1*blIzu6t_wJZ5kOTZxRQ0pA.png" class="kg-image"><figcaption>A quick look at the new <a href="https://scrt.network" data-href="https://scrt.network" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scrt.network</a> webpage.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, the following properties have been established:</p><h4 id="secret-network-official-blog">Secret Network Official Blog</h4><p><a href="https://blog.scrt.network/" rel="noopener"><strong>https://blog.scrt.network</strong></a><strong>‚Ää</strong>‚Äî<em>‚Ääcreated with </em><a href="http://ghost.org/" rel="noopener"><em>Ghost</em></a><em>, what you're reading now!</em></p><h4 id="secret-network-official-chat">Secret Network Official Chat</h4><p><a href="https://chat.scrt.network" rel="noopener"><strong>https://chat.scrt.network</strong></a><strong>‚Ää</strong>‚Äî‚Ää<em>core community real-time </em><a href="https://rocket.chat/" rel="noopener"><em>Rocket.chat</em></a></p><h4 id="secret-network-official-forum">Secret Network Official Forum</h4><p><a href="http://forum.scrt.network" rel="noopener"><strong>https://forum.scrt.network</strong></a><strong>‚Ää</strong><em>‚Äî‚Ääthe existing forum has migrated!</em></p><h4 id="secret-network-documentation">Secret Network Documentation</h4><p><strong><a href="https://docs.scrt.network/‚Ää">https://docs.scrt.network‚Ää</a></strong><em>‚Äî‚Äähosted on GitHub, for devs and validators</em></p><h4 id="secret-network-official-twitter">Secret Network Official Twitter</h4><p><a href="http://twitter.com/secretnetwork" rel="noopener"><strong>https://twitter.com/SecretNetwork</strong></a></p><h4 id="secret-network-telegram-announcements"><strong>Secret Network Telegram Announcements</strong></h4><p><a href="https://t.me/SCRTnetwork" rel="noopener"><strong>https://t.me/SCRTnetwork</strong></a></p><p>More community-maintained channels and resources will be established over the coming weeks and months as the Secret Network community grows.

The interior of the ùïä is private, an enclave that encloses the activity of the network itself.</p><p>The overall shape of the S is reminiscent of a yin-yang, again reflecting the many dualities of a privacy-preserving public network‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa highly complex <strong>technology</strong> that exists to protect deeply <strong>human</strong> values.</p><p>SCRT has been used for staking and governance since the inception of the network in February, with multiple proposals passing successfully (including the rebranding proposal that prompted this announcement).

After this point, <strong>validators on Secret Network will be known as Secret Nodes, where the data being processed will be kept encrypted and secret even from the node itself.</strong></p><p>We are intending to conduct an <strong><em>incentivized testnet</em> </strong>for Secret Network where validators can help test this new functionality and be rewarded for their efforts. This first iteration of secret contracts utilizes Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to keep data private and secure. This means that for the testnet, validators will need to run an SGX-enabled computer or utilize an SGX-enabled cloud operator. For a detailed list of SGX enabled hardware and cloud options, please visit <a href="https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware" rel="noopener">this link</a>.</p><p>There will be many more details shared shortly about the incentivized testnet, but for now we are happy to share with you this <a href="https://bit.ly/secrettestnet" rel="noopener">brief interest form</a> (which was also circulated previously). There‚Äôs a couple questions about your experience with operating nodes or validators for other projects. Please fill this form out, and someone will be in contact with you directly.</p><p>‚Üí <a href="https://bit.ly/secrettestnet" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>https://bit.ly/secrettestnet</strong></a> ‚Üê</p><p><em>But that‚Äôs not all! </em>Even if you‚Äôre not interested in operating nodes on Secret Network, there will also be opportunities for developers, artists, writers, and other community members as part of a broader initiative that we‚Äôre calling the <strong>Secret Games. </strong>Stay tuned to the Secret Network channels for more information. The Games may have already started‚Ä¶</p><h2 id="what-should-i-do-now">What should I do now?</h2><p>We‚Äôd love to have you working alongside us as we expand the Secret Network and its community! Privacy has never been more essential to the blockchain space or to our world at large. Together we can build new types of groundbreaking applications and unlock substantial value while protecting users and their data.</p><p><strong>Validators: </strong>fill out the <a href="https://bit.ly/secrettestnet" rel="noopener">testnet interest form</a>! But also remember that the Secret Network mainnet has been active since February 2020. <a href="https://github.com/enigmampc/SecretNetwork/tree/master/docs/validators-and-full-nodes" rel="noopener">You can already get started running your own node today</a> (with no SGX required).
